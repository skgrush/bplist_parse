A python parser for Apple's binary property list format as defined in
Apple's CFBinaryPList.c source file.

I originally wrote this back in early 2014 so that I could read the output files
from an app called WiFiFoFum. The module that does this can be found in the
wfff_parse directory.

##Warning!

*This code should not be considered stable!* It's been quite a while since
I've looked at this code in depth, and it is not sufficiently tested.
